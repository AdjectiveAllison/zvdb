# zvdb
Zig Vector Database!

NOT WORKING YET! :)

## ZVDB Project Summary: Design Decisions and Goals

### Core Design Decisions

1. Language and Library Focus
   - Implement ZVDB as a Zig library for easy integration into other Zig projects
   - Design a clean and intuitive API for vector database operations

2. Indexing Algorithm
   - Use HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) as the primary indexing algorithm
   - Focus on optimizing HNSW implementation for performance and efficiency

3. Identifier System
   - Utilize auto-incrementing integers (u64) as unique identifiers for vectors

4. Metadata Handling
   - Support dynamic metadata schemas using JSON
   - Allow runtime updates to metadata schema
   - Store metadata schema in the persistent file format

5. Distance Metrics
   - Initially support Cosine and Euclidean distance metrics
   - Design for easy addition of more distance functions in the future

6. Persistence
   - Implement a custom file format (.zvdb) for efficient storage and retrieval
   - Design the file format to include magic number, version, header, vector data, metadata, and index data

7. API Design
   - Provide core functions: init, deinit, add, search, delete, update, save, load, updateMetadataSchema
   - Use a configuration struct for initialization parameters

### Project Goals

1. Performance
   - Optimize for fast similarity search using the HNSW index
   - Ensure efficient vector addition and updates

2. Flexibility
   - Support dynamic metadata schemas to accommodate various use cases
   - Allow for easy extension of distance metrics and other features

3. Persistence
   - Implement robust save and load functionality for long-term data storage
   - Ensure the file format is efficient and extensible

4. Usability
   - Design a clear and intuitive API for Zig developers
   - Provide comprehensive documentation and usage examples

5. Scalability
   - Build with future scalability in mind, considering potential distributed implementations

6. Extensibility
   - Create a foundation that allows for easy addition of new features and optimizations in the future

7. Reliability
   - Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Ensure data integrity during all operations, including saves and loads

8. Ecosystem Development
   - Plan for future integrations with other languages and tools
   - Consider potential for building additional tools around the core library (e.g., CLI, visualization tools)

9. Advanced Indexing Techniques
   - Explore and implement other indexing algorithms (e.g., ANNOY, FAISS) for comparison and specialized use cases

10. User Experience
    - Develop a command-line interface (CLI) for database management
    - Create visualization tools for exploring the vector space

11. Security
    - Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit
    - Add access control and authentication mechanisms

12. Benchmarking and Testing
    - Develop comprehensive benchmarking suite for performance comparisons

## Zig Vector Database File Format

1. Magic Number (4 bytes): "ZVDB" (Zig Vector DataBase)
2. Version (4 bytes): File format version (e.g., 1)
3. Header (variable length):
   - Dimension (4 bytes): Number of dimensions in vectors
   - Distance Function (1 byte): Enum value representing the distance function
   - Index Type (1 byte): Enum value representing the index type
   - Metadata Schema (variable length): Serialized metadata struct definition
4. Vector Data (variable length):
   - Count (8 bytes): Number of vectors
   - For each vector:
     - ID (8 bytes): Unique identifier
     - Vector (dimension * 4 bytes): Vector data as 32-bit floats
5. Metadata (variable length):
   - For each vector:
     - ID (8 bytes): Unique identifier (matching the vector)
     - Serialized Metadata (variable length): Metadata struct data
6. Index Data (variable length):
   - Serialized index structure (format depends on the index type)

This format allows for efficient reading and writing of the database, while maintaining flexibility for different index types and metadata schemas.
